      "detailed_description": "Traditional search engines are more energy-efficient for basic information retrieval. They consume significantly less computational power than large language models and often provide more up-to-date information. Reserve AI tools for tasks that require synthesis, analysis, or creative thinking.",
      "implementation_steps": [
        "Try Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing first",

      "implementation_steps": [
        "Add '-ai' to the end of your search query",

      "description": "Use lightweight models like GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 when the task doesn't require advanced reasoning",
      "detailed_description": "Smaller models consume dramatically less energy and computational resources. GPT-3.5 uses roughly 10x less energy than GPT-4 per query. For many tasks like simple writing, basic coding, or straightforward questions, smaller models are perfectly adequate and much more sustainable.",

Tools like Ollama and GPT4All make it easy to run capable models on consumer hardware. While there's an initial setup cost, local models provide privacy benefits and can be more sustainable for heavy users.",

      "detailed_description": "Poor prompts lead to multiple back-and-forth conversations or edits, multiplying energy consumption. Investing time in crafting specific, well-structured prompts with clear requirements, examples, and constraints dramatically reduces the number of queries needed to achieve your desired outcome.",
